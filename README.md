 <h1 style="display:inline;"> My Gaming Cafe Webapp / Website </h1>  
</header>

<h2> Please Note </h2>
This Webapp / Website was made in Q1 2022 and was my first big project using HTML & CSS, the repository has been migrate from another account and therefore does not contain the original hundreds of commits instead just the up to date project.
</br>
</br>
<h2> About the project </h2>
During my first few weeks in a commerical software development environment I was finding it challenging to keep up, naturally two of my fellow junior developers agreed as it was our first time in the development world, so facing this challenge I proposed we set out to make our very first Webapp / Website from scratch in our free time to sharpen our skills and have something to put up on GitHub, after some convincing they agreed and our first project was born.
</br>
The project intends to emulate a gaming cafe / lounge business in London, we spend lots of time researching into London cafe's taking inspiration from their colour pallets and designs as the project had to have a flashy and modern front-end / website design attracting the main young demographic and keep up with competition, it also had to have a functional back-end with a database to allow the form inputs, booking system inputs and blog write ups to be collected, sorted and stored.
</br>
</br>
<h2>My contributions</h2>
<h3> Leadership:</h3>
Originally there was no intention for anyone to really be the lead on the project especially since we all started our journeys at the same time however as the difference in personality's, ideologies, work ethics, and variation in idea's of my fellow developers started to show I step up using my leadership skills to unify our work into one cohesive project. Creating a trello board, ensuring everyone was on-track for deadlines, scheduling regular meetings via google calendar to check on progress, support each other in learning and socialize getting to know the team. 
</br>
</br>
Constantly played and the strengths of me and my fellow team members and guided them to overcome some weaknesses, for example of my team members didn't quite get the hang of the code as quick as me and our other team member being a non-native English speaker but he constantly brang a positive attitude, was always beaming with idea's and loved hustling to find solutions for the project therefore as the lead of the project I recognised his strength and guided him to research, collected resources and brainstorm while me and our other team member worked on the code, I then also went through code with him till he understood and was able to contribute. </br>
</br>
<h2>Design:</h2>
After a rough colourless mockup of the project I kickstarted the design by our eye catching , colour changing and animated navigation bar. This was a crucial step as it was the first professional looking and fully done part of the site. The navigation bar also set a unique theme and design while also ironing out our colour pallete setting the tone for the rest of the project.
</br>
</br>
<h2>Pages:</h2>
Each team member had there own UI Elements and pages to work on with the help / polish from others if need be. Some of the things I created include : The navigation bar, booking pages, enquiry page, cookie policy page , privacy policy page ...
</br>
</br>
<h2>Backend:</h2>
As the developer on the team who is really passionate about and has strong C# , .NET and OOP skills I wrote a huge portion of the backend
